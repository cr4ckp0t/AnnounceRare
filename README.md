# Announce Rare 2

This is a simple addon to assist others in the same zone as you when you find a rare. It will announce the rare's name, current health, engaged or not, coordinates, and provide a push pin to quickly locate the mob. Death announcements are also provided so others won't waste their time coming to your location only to find a death mob.

Announcements are sent via chat links when you target a rare mob that is tracked. _Due to API changes made in 8.2.5, announcements cannot be sent automatically._ It requires user interaction, such as clicking the link in the chat message when you target a rare or when a tracked mob dies.

## Chat Command
